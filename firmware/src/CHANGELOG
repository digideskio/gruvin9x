Changes in v1.2

+ Improved battery voltage calibrartion system. Changes are now instant (instead
  of waiting for the running average to kick in) and accurate to 2 decimal places,
  like most digital multimeters.

Committed r485 (/branches/frsky)

+ Fixed double-size outdez decimal point and time colon (again)

+ Added code to allow 4096 byte EEPROM storage space on V2 PCB. Unfortuantely, this
  breaks compatibility with the 2048 byte EEPROM file format, due to having to 
  increase the block size from 16 to 32 bytes.

+ Issue 17: Fr-Sky Page 1/3 off-screen write causes crash, fixed.

+ Issue 15: Added make directive 'PPMIN=MOD1' (as default -- use PPMIN=STD to
  disable) to align with hardware hack to make the '9X compatible with
  Spektrum (and no doubt others) radio PPM signals (of lower voltage etc).  See
  http://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/wiki/PpmIn for details.

  Also updated pcb/hacked/gruvin9x-hacked.sch/pdf circuit schematic files to 
  include changes made for the above.

+ Removed decimal portion of output values in proc0 main page view (they
  just make things look messy and in fact, less precise, due to rouding
  errors etc.)

+ More minor font edits (dblsize 'G' and 'N' changed slightly)

+ ER9X's nice new fonts (contributed by Michael Torrie) include a change where the 
  @ symbol has been changed to a ยบ (degrees symbol). I moved the little circle in 
  both font files left, to sit on the left hand edge of the character cell, rather 
  than the right. (I think it looks better is all.)

+ Issue 10: Moved PPM-in pulse processing to pulse capture ISR function to fix
  buffer overflows and, more importantly, make servo motion considerably smoother
  when under trainee control.

+ Introduced different beep/tone frequencies (BEEPSPKR version only) for mix warning 
  beeps (1, 2 and 3)

+ Issue 11 (invalidated): Added text "[MENU] to refresh" to STAT2 page

+ Fixed issue 8: faulty mix warning beeps

+ CHANGELOG introduced

+ Fr-Sky support v1.0 merged into trunk

+ ER9X's better fonts (contributed by Michael Torrie) introduced (with slashes removed 
  from zeroes.)

+ Issue 9: Bug in PPM_IN capture values fixed

+ Some minor tweaks in display format of times

+ Resurrected the old sub-version auto-counter in the form of a "build number"
