USBasp Firmware, modified for use with gruvin9x custom controller board.

NOTES ...

As at 2011-12-11, GPROG is NOT ready for use. There's a problem with the buffer
chip tying up the MOSI/MISO/SCK/RESET lines. The fix will required changed to the
hardware design.

This version of USBasp is based on the original 2009-02-28 version -- the last
one to fit in the ATmega48P -- with the support added from the 2011-05-28
version to implement extended addressing for target AVR chips with greater than
128KBytes Flash, like the ATmega2560 that we use.

There was (still is as at 2011-05-28 version) a bug  in the original USBasp
code for extended addressing in that it assumed that the target chip's extended
address would be automatically reset to 0x00 after power-up and/or entering
programming mode. This is not the case. In fact, I found the extended addresses
contents to be somewhat random, usually causing all the programmed code to wind
up 64KBytes higher in address space than it should have been.

The default SCK clock speed has been increased from 375KHz to 1.5MHz, although
the gain is not that much, due to the software implemented USB stack taking up
quite a lot of CPU time.

Strangely, having the brown-out detector on the ATmega48 enabled causes my
(Gruvin) Mac (running OS X 10.7) to not detect the USBasp device. So I've
disabled the BOD feature, apaprently without ill effect.
