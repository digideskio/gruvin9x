This folder contains the current "under development" version of the various PCBs.

MAIN PCB
========
This PCB is a rework of Gruvin's V3.0 PCB to use the 100pin ATMega 2560. It was primarily done to enable the 
use of JTAG debugging and also to free up some pins for future fun. (Cam). Most of the work was done by Cam,
which has been just wonderful. Thanks Cam! (Gruvin)

. All six (x4) push button switch holes enlarged to allow factory assembly, without manual adjustments to component legs.
. Changes made around Q2/Q3 pseudo RS-232 buffers to improve waveform profiles. R117 was added. Other resistors were reduced in value.
